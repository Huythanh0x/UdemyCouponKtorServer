This is also true for children who meet these criteria. Whilst it is the responsibility of the local authority to initially draft the layout of the plan, following a needs-based assessment of a child, (with the agreement of the parents, teachers, health care professionals, or the young person if aged between 16 and 25), the local authority must equally incorporate health and social care provisions to ensure the overall wellbeing for the child or young person.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Many local authorities are failing to meet these requirements, even though the SEND code of practice clearly states what an EHCP should include. The Department for Education issues a deadline of 20 weeks to get these plans in place. In July 2019, data showed that over three thousand children were awaiting the provision specified in their EHCP. So, even though professionals have identified the needs of the children, those needs are still not being met.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The covid-19 did not help matters, further widening the gap between children and their needs.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Our SEN, EHCP and Tribunal Preparation Course will deliver expert advice to parents and teachers involved in the care of children with additional needs. You will learn how to improve your approach to developing and implementing EHCPs, ensuring that statutory requirements are being met so that your children are provided with the help that they are entitled to.<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p>This program covers various learning difficulties, various therapies that could help your child, SEN provision, EHCP's and the appeals process, and references to the laws in England where appropriate.<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p>You will gain awareness and understanding of what is involved during a diagnostic assessment. You will be introduced to child psychotherapies and the beautiful world of creative therapies, understanding how these therapies can benefit the children in your care. You will also be introduced to different types of learning bearing in mind that children are individuals with individualistic learning styles.<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p>As they say, it takes a village to raise a child; we can help all our children, together.<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p><strong>You will gain:<\/strong><\/p><p>24/7 access to the course anytime.<\/p><p>No hidden fees.<\/p><p>Knowledge in the application process of SEN, EHCP, and Tribunals.<\/p><p>Better earning potential.<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p><strong>Who should study this course?<\/strong><\/p><p>Teachers, parents, childminders, health care professionals, psychotherapists, creative therapists, and family members of children with additional needs. Anybody who works with children should be aware of the difficulties they might be facing.<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p>'I must confess, as a teacher, I initially thought this course would<\/p><p>only be well suited to SEND teachers and parents only. I decided to do<\/p><p>it anyway and I am pleased to say it has been mind blowing.<\/p><p>A child in my class has just been awarded an EHCP and watching the joy of the<\/p><p>parents is enough reward.

It is a process in which one person or entity tries to influence another person or group of people to change their beliefs or behaviours. It is distinct from coercion, in that the people receiving the message have a choice about whether to act on it.<\/p><p>Persuasive messages are symbolic (using words, images, and sounds) and may be transmitted verbally or nonverbally, via media or face-to-face communication. Persuasion may be overt or subtle. Understanding how it works can help you become more aware of how you are influenced by persuasive messages.<\/p><p>How can you change someone\u2019s mind? And how are you swayed by others? Persuasion refers to the influence people have on one another\u2014changing someone\u2019s beliefs, decisions, or actions through reasoning or request.<\/p><p>Choosing the right principle for persuasion depends on the context. In a corporate context, a brand hoping to boost sales may leverage the authority principle by securing an expert\u2019s endorsement. In a social context, an individual may deepen a relationship by inviting an acquaintance to a birthday party; due to the reciprocity principle, the acquaintance may then return the favour another time.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>You will learn:<\/strong><\/p><ol><li><p>Psychology of Persuasion &amp; Influence<\/p><\/li><li><p>Understanding Deception &amp; Manipulation<\/p><\/li><li><p>How to use Cognitive Biases in real life<\/p><\/li><li><p>How to improve communication skills<\/p><\/li><li><p>How to become influential and persuasive<\/p><\/li><li><p>Persuasion Hacks based on Psychology of Thinking Errors <\/p><\/li><li><p>How to read Minds (Somewhat)<\/p><\/li><li><p>How to control Minds (Somewhat)<\/p><\/li><li><p>Robert Cialdini principles of persuasion<\/p><\/li><li><p>Effective Communication Techniques from Neuro Linguistic Programming NLP<\/p><\/li><li><p>How to convince people easily<\/p><\/li><li><p>Words that Persuade and Influence<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","language":"English","title":"Laws of Persuasion & Influence and How to use them","previewVideo":"/course/1554224/preview/?startPreviewId=13787476","reviews":53,"usesRemaining":567,"contentLength":163,"category":"Personal Development","courseId":1554224,"couponCode":"E5CDE57BBF72D23DDA77","previewImage":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1554224_af5c_17.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"Beginner Level","heading":"Home Education, Home Schooling, Child-Education, Parents, Teachers, Small School Business","author":"Ini Baker","expiredDate":"2023-04-22 09:53:00+00:00","rating":0,"students":788,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/micro-pod-and-home-education-schooling/?couponCode=F2B0C862523A20482F4F","description":"<p><strong>MICRO-POD AND HOME EDUCATION DIPLOMA<\/strong><\/p><p>The micro-pod system emerged after the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and has increased in thousands of homes worldwide.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.<\/p><p><br><strong>- Open source code<\/strong><\/p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.<\/p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br><\/p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. <\/p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. <\/em><\/strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge<\/strong><\/p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!<\/p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. <\/p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br><\/p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students<\/strong><\/p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. <\/p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) <\/p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. <\/p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. <\/em><\/strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br><\/p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson<\/strong><\/p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. <\/p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)<\/em><\/strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.<\/p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. <\/p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! <\/p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! <\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company!

We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Introduction to Machine Learning<\/strong><\/p><p>In this section we will learn - What does Machine Learning mean. What are the meanings or different terms associated with machine learning? You will see some examples so that you understand what machine learning actually is. It also contains steps involved in building a machine learning model, not just linear models, any machine learning model.<\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Data Preprocessing<\/strong><\/p><p>In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.<\/p><p>We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation and correlation.<\/strong><\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Section 5 - Regression Model<\/strong><\/p><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.<\/p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it,&nbsp; it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.<\/p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in Python will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!<\/strong><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Cheers<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy<\/strong><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>------------<\/p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-<\/p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?<\/strong><\/p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.<\/p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?<\/strong><\/p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.<\/p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).<\/p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.<\/p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.<\/p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?<\/strong><\/p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:<\/p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique<\/p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy<\/p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret<\/p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning<\/p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?<\/strong><\/p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.<\/p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?<\/strong><\/p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.<\/p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:<\/p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.<\/p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.<\/p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.<\/p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.<\/p>","language":"Hindi","title":"Machine Learning Basics in Hindi हिंदी - Regression Analysis","previewVideo":"/course/4555584/preview/?startPreviewId=39414946","reviews":272,"usesRemaining":537,"contentLength":337,"category":"Development","courseId":4555584,"couponCode":"254743C","previewImage":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4555584_d0c9_2.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"All Levels","heading":"Learn How To Grab Favicon Using JavaScript & How To Create Favicon Grabber Website","author":"Narendra Dwivedi","expiredDate":"2023-04-21 04:54:00+00:00","rating":4.150804,"students":27474,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/favicon-grabber/?couponCode=63BCACF423B7B14C6DC8","description":"<p>In This Course , You Will Learn How To <strong>Grab Favicon Using JavaScript <\/strong>From Scratch.

can learn <strong>Functional Programming in Java with Lambda expressions (anonymous functions), Method references, and Stream API. <\/strong><\/p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; <\/strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples<\/strong><\/p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.<\/p><p><br><strong>- Open source code<\/strong><\/p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.<\/p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br><\/p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. <\/p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. <\/em><\/strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge<\/strong><\/p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!<\/p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. <\/p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br><\/p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students<\/strong><\/p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. <\/p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) <\/p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. <\/p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. <\/em><\/strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br><\/p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson<\/strong><\/p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. <\/p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)<\/em><\/strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.<\/p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. <\/p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>So don't wait!

In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. <\/p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. <\/em><\/strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge<\/strong><\/p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!<\/p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. <\/p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br><\/p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students<\/strong><\/p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. <\/p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) <\/p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. <\/p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. <\/em><\/strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br><\/p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson<\/strong><\/p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. <\/p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)<\/em><\/strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.<\/p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. <\/p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>So don't wait!

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. <br><br>React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.<br><br>Through a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.<br><br>In addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.<\/p><p><br><\/p>","language":"English","title":"Build a Connect-4 Clone in React + JavaScript Foundations","previewVideo":"/course/4789918/preview/?startPreviewId=43460982","reviews":65,"usesRemaining":425,"contentLength":339,"category":"Development","courseId":4789918,"couponCode":"YOUACCEL25962","previewImage":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789918_7294.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"All Levels","heading":"Migra un sitio web de WordPress a otro dominio o hosting, sin saber de programación, de forma fácil y simple.","author":"Renato Jesús Yacolca Neyra","expiredDate":"2023-04-20 13:44:00+00:00","rating":3.581976,"students":5467,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/como-migrar-un-sitio-web-de-wordpress-a-otro-dominio-o-hosting/?couponCode=SM-GR9","description":"<p><strong>¿DESEAS APRENDER A MIGRAR UN SITIO WEB DE WORDPRESS A OTRO DOMINIO O HOSTING?<\/strong><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Únete a nuestro curso para mostrarte cómo migrar un sitio web de WordPress completo a otro dominio o hosting, para dicho proceso, podemos utilizar uno de estos dos plugins: All in One WP Migration o SiteGround Migrator.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>All in One WP Migration<\/strong> es un plugin que facilita la migración de un sitio hecho en WordPress de forma rápida y sencilla. <\/p><p><br>Permite exportar todo el contenido como entradas, post, plugins, base de datos, imágenes, temas, etc.<\/p><p><br>Para realizar este proceso no necesitas ningún tipo de conocimiento técnico ni de programación, ya que se realiza de una forma fácil y veloz.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Para migrar un sitio web en WordPress con el plugin All in One WP Migration, básicamente hay que realizar los siguientes pasos:<br><\/p><ul><li><p>Instalar el plugin All-in-One WP Migration.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Dar clic al botón de exportar para compilar tu base de datos, archivos de medios, plugins, y temas en un archivo compacto.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Desempacar el archivo en la nueva ubicación o dominio con una función de \u201carrastrar y soltar\u201d fácil de usar en el panel de WordPress de tu nuevo sitio web.<\/p><p><br><\/p><\/li><\/ul><p><strong>SiteGround Migrator<\/strong> es un plugin gratuito de WordPress desarrollado por SiteGround que nos ayuda a<strong>&nbsp;migrar un sitio web con WordPress a tu cuenta en SiteGround desde cualquier otra compañía de alojamiento web.<\/strong><\/p><p><br>Para migrar un sitio web en WordPress con el plugin SiteGround Migrator, básicamente hay que realizar los siguientes pasos:<br><\/p><ul><li><p>Generar un token de migración en el Site Tools de SiteGround.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Instalar el plugin SiteGround Migrator en tu WordPress.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Pegar el token de migración en el plugin para comenzar la migración.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Comprobar tu sitio y actualizar los registros DNS para terminar la migración.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><p><strong>¿QUÉ ME CALIFICA PARA ENSEÑARTE?<br><br><\/strong>Mi nombre es Renato y soy el creador de uno de los canales de YouTube más populares del mundo en el sector del marketing digital: <strong>Programación Fácil, SEO y Marketing<\/strong>, con más de <strong>170,000 estudiantes (Botón de Plata de YouTube)<\/strong>, más de <strong>80 MILLONES de reproducciones<\/strong> y miles de comentarios en mis tutoriales, tales como estos:<br><br><\/p><ul><li><p><em>Hola te felicito por los tutoriales, muy bien explicados y sobretodo de mucha utilidad.

Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously.

To run a business at optimal capacity, you need to reduce or eliminate waste from processes and improve production flow. In this course, you'll learn about Lean strategies to reduce waste by determining which operations add value and which don't. You'll explore the concept of continuous flow, and discover how to balance work processes to make production flow more efficient. You'll define what waste is, where it exists, and what causes it. You'll also examine aspects of Muda, continuous flow, line balancing, value and non-value-add, and practical Lean techniques for improving Operations Management.<\/p><p><strong>What is waste in Lean Manufacturing?<\/strong><\/p><p>A core principle in lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. And in any business, one of the heaviest drains on profitability is waste. Lean waste can come in the form of time, material, and labor. But it may also be related to the utilization of skill-sets as well as poor planning. In lean manufacturing, waste is any expense or effort that is expended but which does not transform raw materials into an item the customer is willing to pay for. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, the only true value is added at each phase of production.<\/p><p>Today, the Lean Manufacturing model recognizes 8 types of waste within an operation; seven originally conceived when the Toyota Production System was first conceived, and an eighth added when the lean methodology was adopted within the Western World. Seven of the eight wastes are production process-oriented, while the eighth waste is directly related to management\u2019s ability to utilize personnel.<\/p><p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN to<\/strong><\/p><ol><li><p>classify production activities as a value-add, non-value-add, or necessary non-value-add.<\/p><\/li><li><p>identify strategies for eliminating waste caused by overproduction and inventory.<\/p><\/li><li><p>identify strategies for eliminating motion, waiting, and transportation waste.<\/p><\/li><li><p>identify elimination strategies for waste caused by overprocessing and defects<\/p><\/li><li><p>match cycle time and takt time to their descriptions<\/p><\/li><li><p>identify the final three steps for balancing a production line<\/p><\/li><\/ol>","language":"English","title":"The Concept of  Waste","previewVideo":"/course/4584528/preview/?startPreviewId=40224866","reviews":13,"usesRemaining":748,"contentLength":49,"category":"Business","courseId":4584528,"couponCode":"36999E5841714B32D37E","previewImage":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4584528_2810_3.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"Beginner Level","heading":"Forest Education, Nature Study, Child-Learning Therapy, Nature Therapy, Plants education, woodland","author":"Ini Baker","expiredDate":"2023-04-22 05:30:00+00:00","rating":5,"students":2475,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/forest-school-and-woodland-pedagogy-diploma/?couponCode=E0B372A36C5A3EF1DE28","description":"<p>Forest School and Woodland Pedagogy Diploma Overview and Curriculum<\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p><strong>What will I benefit from this course?<\/strong><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>\u200b<\/p><p>Forest school education is based on a learning method that introduces children to nature by encouraging them to learn in their outdoor space using woodland areas, forests, and outdoor environments.

Depending on the topic, I can be very tired of talking, and feel high levels of frustration and cynicism when the talk does not lead anywhere aside from a report in a desk drawer or in an attached document deep in an inbox. Even more frustrating is the realization that the talk was heard by folks who had already made up their minds about what needed to be done. This frustration has definitely led to occasional reticence to participate, and suspicion of the ideas generated in such discussions.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Healthy dialogue is extremely important to strengthen and expand cooperation in the community and one of the main ways of resolving conflicts is communication between people. This is the most common method and includes talks.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>It is important to prepare a suitable environment for dialogue; while dialogue is often confused with other forms of discourse, it belongs in a distinctive category of its own; it doesn't involve arguing for a point of view, as debates, it's not a method of reaching agreement or taking decisions as negotiation, it does not only emerge when participants trust and respect each other, interrupt their judgments, and listen to all points of view, as discussions. So it is important to find a mutual or common ground between the parties in the community, for example, talking about exciting things for both sides, and should be carried out with a focus on a win-win solution. The methods of dialogue involve the interaction of collective individuals; in daily life, conflicts can be resolved through dialogue and various types of communication.

Throughout the community dialogue, a variety of activities will be used to foster community collaboration. These activities will engage stakeholders/partners at all levels, break down silos, drive innovation, and institute partnerships and collaboration among a variety of community stakeholders to work together to define a unanimous project scope, roles, and responsibilities.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The aim of the dialogue is to share information, find mutual thoughts, and recognize existing links between different relations and various extents of cooperation. The dialogue should be smoothly flexible, according to the context, and conducted within the structure, in the appropriate format and level, including regional, sub-regional or national levels, regional and sub-regional organizations, as well as representatives of NGOs, should be bound by this dialogue in order to achieve the good well in the community first and then to create a good nation-state. Good governance should strengthen the internal and external ties of the Parties and make a fundamental constituent of this dialogue. Finally, the expansion of social dialogue and covering most socioeconomic problems is a sign of the prevailing model of social partnership; because over time the practice of social dialogue will overcome limits; resolve purely people relations and conflicts.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p>","language":"English","title":"Dialogue in Dilemma- Power of Communication","previewVideo":"/course/5004316/preview/?startPreviewId=45228516","reviews":19,"usesRemaining":639,"contentLength":99,"category":"Business","courseId":5004316,"couponCode":"DIALOGUE_423_FREE","previewImage":"https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5004316_5db2.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"All Levels","heading":"Project managemet, EVM, Agile, Cost Control, EVM Expert, Planned value, Earned value and  Actual costs, PMP","author":"Dr. José J","expiredDate":"2023-04-21 06:47:00+00:00","rating":4.274202,"students":9041,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/earned-value-management-evm-project-management-pmp/?couponCode=ACBC21964009B2F7839F","description":"<p>Master course in earned value management&nbsp; (EVM) ; Get a clear understanding of one of today's most effective management techniques.

I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <\/p><p><br><\/p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey. Being a parent I know the toughest thing is to have your child express their feeling to you. We have covered this most important aspect of creative self-expression through different exercises and fun methods.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Are you a Non Profit or Charity helping the world?<\/strong><\/p><p>Awesome!

Political sociology deals with the relationship between state and society on the basis of mutual interaction and with power as the ultimate aim.<\/p><p>The course is provided both in the form of part-time as well as on correspondence basis. Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. Traditionally, there were four main areas of research.<\/p><p>1. The sociopolitical formation of the modern state<\/p><p>2. How social inequality between groups (class, race, gender) influences politics<\/p><p>3. How public opinion, ideologies, personalities, social movements, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics<\/p><p>4. Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media)<\/p><p>Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the founding fathers of sociology \u2013 Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber \u2013 to such contemporary theorists as Anthony Giddens, Jurgen Habermas and Michael Mann. <\/p><p>In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis, which overlaps with Marxist analysis. Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the \"power structure\" or \"instrumentalist\" approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff.<\/p>","language":"English","title":"Political Sociology- An Introduction","previewVideo":"/course/3599646/preview/?startPreviewId=30093736","reviews":43,"usesRemaining":796,"contentLength":153,"category":"Teaching & Academics","courseId":3599646,"couponCode":"POLSOL_FREE_423","previewImage":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3599646_e2ec_3.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"All Levels","heading":"\"Mastering Storm Water Systems: A Comprehensive Guide to Plumbing Installation, Maintenance and Repair\"","author":"EngineeringHub Academy","expiredDate":"2023-04-20 12:00:00+00:00","rating":4.763505,"students":2955,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/plumbing-storm-water-mastery-effective-design-maintenance/?couponCode=7757EDC929166A6AB05C","description":"<p>Introducing the ultimate <strong>Storm Water System course!<\/strong> <\/p><p>Perfect for engineers, contractors, and government officials, this comprehensive course covers everything you need to know about designing, implementing, and maintaining a stormwater system.

The diversity of the various methods and disciplines on which we draw and the range of the social and intellectual purposes we serve are too great to permit an orthodoxy to develop. Yet, as a result of our discussions and publications during these past two decades, it has become clear that there is a distinctive activity - what we have come to call practical ethics - that merits serious curricular and scholarly attention in the modern university, alongside the traditional disciplines in arts and sciences and in the professional schools. Three characteristics of practical ethics are significant.<\/p><p>First, practical ethics is a linking discipline, seeking to bridge theory and practice. But it differs from both applied ethics and professional ethics as they are usually understood. We remain as convinced as when we began that moral and political philosophy are essential disciplines for our work. At the same time, we now see more clearly that philosophical principles cannot be applied in any straightforward way to particular problems and policies. In the face of concrete dilemmas, we need to revise philosophical principles as much as we rely on them for justification. One reason is that principles often conflict: how, for example, should an attorney reconcile her commitment to a guilty client (a principle of loyalty) with her commitment to the truth (a principle of veracity)? Understanding such conflicts calls for critical analysis and elaboration of the principles, a process that is distinct from both deductive application and case-by-case intuition. We have also learned that moral reasoning as conventionally understood is not the only important element in deliberation about practical moral questions. Equally significant are moral perception - the ability to recognize an ethical issue in a complex set of circumstances - and moral character - the disposition to live ethically in a coherent way over time. A business executive, for example, may be disposed to act morally in his personal life, but may not see that moral issues are raised in his professional life when he decides to close a plant, or to accept the health risks of workplace hazards. To better understand these dimensions of moral life, practical ethics must draw on other disciplines and other forms of knowledge in addition to philosophy. Understanding ethical decisions in such professions as business, government, law, and medicine obviously requires knowledge of those professions, but beyond that it needs the assistance of moral psychology, sociology, economics and political science.<\/p><p>We have also become more critical of professional ethics as it has been taught in many professional schools. Practical ethics in the professions should consist of more than a study of the codes of ethics, such as the legal profession's code and model rules, or the emulation of role models, as in clinical rounds in teaching hospitals. These may be an important part of moral education in the professions, but if they are the principal part they reinforce parochial and technical conceptions of professional life. Practical ethics tries to relate professional rules and clinical experience to the broader social context in which professionals practice, and to the deeper moral assumptions on which professions depend.<\/p><p>Among the questions we have found significant are conflicts between duties of professional roles and those of general morality; conflicts within professional roles arising from competing understandings of the purposes of a profession; the duty of professionals to serve the public good; the legitimacy of professional authority; and the accountability of professionals. To address these kinds of questions, we have further sought to relate professional ethics to some of the larger questions prominent in recent philosophy such as the relativism of justice, the foundation of rights, and the limits of morality.<\/p><p>A second feature of practical ethics we have emphasized is its institutional context. Most people live most of their lives under the influence of institutions - schools, corporations, hospitals, media organizations - working for them or coping with them in one way or another. Yet ethics, both as an academic discipline and as concrete practice, has tended to focus either on relations among individuals, or on the structures of society as a whole. It has neglected that middle range of intermediate associations, of which institutions are the most durable and influential. Institutions are the site of many of our most difficult moral problems, as well as the source for many of our most promising solutions. We need to pay attention, for example, not just to the ethics of doctor-patient relations, or to the justice of health care policy, but also to what might be called hospital ethics. On what basis should hospitals allocate scarce beds in the intensive care unit? What rights should professionals and other employees have to dissent from a hospital's policy on, for example, AIDS precautions or physician-assisted suicide? To address such questions adequately, practical ethics must go beyond the moral principles of individual ethics, yet pay attention to the moral life that dwells among the structures of society.<\/p><p>Through the years, we have also recognized that many of the issues that professionals face go well beyond the practice of their profession. That is one reason we have devoted at least as much attention to more general ethical issues, such as the questions of war and peace, global justice, environmental responsibility, the problem of immigration, standards for political campaigns, and the role of religion in public life.<\/p><p>The third characteristic of practical ethics that has become increasingly important is its political nature. Practical ethics is political because it cannot avoid the question of authority: who should decide? The distinction between the right decision and the right to make the decision is especially significant in practical ethics because people reasonably disagree about many ethical issues - for example, abortion or capital punishment. Practical ethics has to provide principles for resolving, or at least accommodating, such disagreement. It is not simply a matter of choosing a particular procedure (majority rule, informed consent, shareholder proxies, and the like) to settle such disputes fairly but finally. We have found it more illuminating to think of the problem as involving a process of deliberation - continuing interaction in which the way the disputants relate to each other is as important as the question of who has the right to make the decision in the end. Practical ethics in the professions is also political in another, more familiar sense: it addresses the question of who should regulate the ethics of the professions. This question takes on new significance as the tension between the ideal of the self-regulating profession and the reality of market-oriented professionals becomes increasingly salient. We should be reluctant to abandon the ideal since it has traditionally expressed the principle of service to others, which is the ethical essence of a profession. But patients, clients, customers and citizens are legitimately seeking more control over the professions, sometimes through the market, and sometimes through politics and the law. Professional ethics, as many professionals themselves insist, is too important to all of us to be left only to professionals. The pressing challenge for the future is to forge, in principle and in practice, a union of the traditional idea of the autonomous profession (preserving its ethics of service) and the modern demand for accountability (acknowledging an ethics of responsibility). Beyond the professions, the challenge is to find the principles and practices that will enable all of us to acknowledge what we owe to one another in the public life that we inevitably share. The ethics of public life is too important to be left only to ethicists.<\/p>","language":"English","title":"Practical Ethics- New Dynamics","previewVideo":"/course/4460988/preview/?startPreviewId=44960460","reviews":3,"usesRemaining":690,"contentLength":104,"category":"Teaching & Academics","courseId":4460988,"couponCode":"FREE_PE_423","previewImage":"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4460988_b01a_2.jpg"},{"subCategory":"Unknown","level":"All Levels","heading":"Step by step practical guideline to master in architectural photography, night photography and HDR photography","author":"Creative Online School","expiredDate":"2023-04-20 04:04:00+00:00","rating":4.2175627,"students":90734,"couponUrl":"https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-architectural-night-hdr-photography/?couponCode=HDRAPR2023","description":"<p>Architectural photography is one of the important branches of photography.

Le aporta seriedad, confianza y autoridad a tu marca ante tus clientes y proveedores.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>De este modo, el dominio te ayuda a mostrar una imagen que refleje compromiso y confianza, y además es una forma de permitir que los usuarios identifiquen fácilmente tu negocio online.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Y es que no genera mucha confianza una empresa cuyo correo electrónico sea una cuenta de Gmail o de Outlook (Hotmail).<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Contactar a ventas@tumarca(.)com es más serio que escribir a ventas.tumarca@gmail(.)com. Así se generará la sensación de que tu marca no cuida suficientemente los detalles.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Comunicación más efectiva:<\/strong> Muchos emprendedores suelen mezclar las soluciones de comunicación efectivas con las que son de carácter gratuito.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Con esto nos referimos a que elegir una cuenta de correo electrónico gratuito significa quedar atado a ciertas características indeseables. Imaginemos que le enviamos una propuesta interesante a uno de nuestros mejores clientes. Es posible que, ese email termine perdido en la bandeja de Spam, por lo que se aumentan las probabilidades de que nunca sea abierto.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Un gran porcentaje de cuentas gratuitas se utiliza para hacer spam y tus mail pueden ser catalogados de la misma manera si son de cuentas gratuitas.

Esto significa que Google tendrá acceso a tu información, por lo que esta será usada para mostrarte publicidad personalizada.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>En cambio, con un dominio y servidor propio, tendrás la tranquilidad de mantener los datos y la información de tu empresa en buenas manos, pues tu empresa de hosting te garantiza no compartir esta información con terceros. Así, solo tu tendrás control absoluto de tu información.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Mayor seguridad de tus correos:<\/strong> al momento de gestionar una cuenta de correos esto es muy importante. Casi todos los servicios de correos corporativos tienen mayores medidas y protocolos de seguridad ante el posible hackeo o ataque a través de virus por terceros.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. <\/em><\/p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence<\/em><\/strong> (<strong><em>AI<\/em><\/strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.<\/p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:<\/strong><\/p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. <\/p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. <\/p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. <\/p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. <\/p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?<\/strong><\/p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.<\/p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.<\/em><\/strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.<\/p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. <\/p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?<\/strong><\/p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.<\/p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?<\/strong><\/p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"<\/strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;<\/strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. <\/p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. <\/p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).<\/p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.

We start right from the basics, where we explore the Lightroom interface and creating an image catalog. From there students learn to configure catalog settings while using the import dialog and import file handling. In this section students also learn to work with metadata presets, and preferences related to import options. Once students have a handle on the foundations, the course takes an in-depth look into file formats and color space. Here, we demonstrate the importance of understanding various image compression types and the quality vs size trade off. We discuss RAW vs JPEG vs TIFF files, along with color space comparisons between sRGB, RGB and CMYK. Students also learn the concept of image resolution and the importance of pixel density in determining image quality.<br><br>In section three, we complete our overview of the Lightroom interface by showcasing a few more essential features. This includes a number of file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate configuration, and watermarking.<br><br>Once students have a firm handle on the foundations, the course transitions into exploring the Lightroom slideshow module. Here, students learn how to navigate the slideshow interface and create stunning slideshows from image collections using various slideshow templates. We also cover a number of tools to spruce up the overall look of a slideshow using text overlays, and embedded media objects such as music and video. Lastly, students will learn how to export a slideshow using various file formats and compression options. <br><br>After completion of the slideshow module, we dive into the print module. Here students will learn how to navigate the print module interface and setup print templates to produce studio quality images on both home and commercial grade printers. Students will learn important concepts such as soft proofing, page setup, layout style, custom templates, and print job configuration. <br><br>The last section of the course provides a quick guide to publishing image collections to the web, using the Lightroom Web module. We start with an overview of the interface before exploring various layout options and the color palette. We then move on to the appearance panel, and output configuration before demonstrating how to publish the gallery using various web file formats. <br><br>As you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off with Lightroom. It\u2019s also a great resource for both professional and aspiring photographers that are looking to take their existing photos to the next level.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.<\/p><p><strong>Why Become an Electrical System Technician? <\/strong><\/p><p>In the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!<\/p><p>Today\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed.

Başlamak için 1 resim kalemi 1 silgi ve 1 kağıt yeterlidir. Evde bulunabilecek malzeme ve materyaller ile başlayabilirsiniz. Öncelikle başlangıçta kalemleri tanımak, kalem tutuşu, hangi kalem seçimi yapacağımızı göreceğiz. Mesafe, derinlik, dolgu, tonlama, ışık-gölge, yakın-uzak ilişkisi, tümsek-çukur, tek kaçış noktalı perspektif, iki kaçış noktalı perspektif, üç kaçış noktalı perspektif çizimleri yapacağız. Ayrıca imgesel de çalışacağız yani hayal gücüne dayalı rastgele olacak. Yaratıcılığı artırıcı ve bakış açısını değiştiren bir eğitim olacaktır. Artık öğrencilerim çok yönlü bakıp düşünebilecekler. Bunun haricinde bakarak obje, nesne çizimi yapabilecekler. 3 boyutlu çizimlerin çeşitlerinden bahsedeceğiz bunun içerisinde kağıt kesme işlemi yaparak da farklı 3 boyutlu çizimler de yapacağız. Bu eğitimin en güzel yanı da 7 yaş ve üzeri her yaşa hitap etmesidir. <\/p><p>Yalnız resim işi severek isteyerek yapmakla olur. Kimi çalışmalar uzun süre uğraş verilmesi isteyebilir.

Ta ki evlenip çocuğum olana kadar ve çocuğum benden sürekli hayvan resimleri çizmemi istediğinden hayvan figürleri sonrasında da 3 boyutlu çizime yöneldim.

It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.<\/p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.<\/p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".<\/p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?<\/strong><\/p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral<\/strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.<\/p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?<\/p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.<\/p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.<\/p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.<\/p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee<\/strong><\/p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content.

Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.<\/p><p>The Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as \u201cA fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\".<\/p><p>Six Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time. Six Sigma aspires to do the following - in general:<\/p><ul><li><p>Determine a problem.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Gather information about the problem's occurrence process.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Develop prospective problem-solving data-driven solutions.<\/p><\/li><li><p>To determine the best alternative, put the solutions to the test.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Create a system that will allow you to maintain a long-term solution.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Analyze the data and make any necessary adjustments. <\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>Let's get down to what this online course talks about. This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma's emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).<\/p><p>Please note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn't according to the client's specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer's perspective using Six Sigma methodology.<\/p><p><strong>Why opt for this course - the proven game-changer?<\/strong><\/p><p>By completing this<strong> \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\"<\/strong>, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.&nbsp;<\/p><p>If you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!<\/p><p><em>This mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don't want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.&nbsp;What's more?

Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It's a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend's Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.<\/p><p>The fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!! The health and fitness tech business is greatly growing at a breakneck pace, thanks to advances in wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and even mixed reality, making it an exciting time for both customers and developers.<\/p><p>Oculus stealthily released a fitness tracker called Oculus Move that sits inside its Quest headsets in the final days of 2020. Users who download the software can climb on a ticker hovering above or below their field of view to see how many calories they burn in virtual reality, as well as how many minutes they spend physically active. They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker's dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.<\/p><p>Apps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of every year, according to the World Economic Forum. It's a big increase, demonstrating how popular home fitness has become, with hundreds of subscription-based options now accessible. One standout brand has been setting the pace and capitalising on consumer demand called 360 Wellness.&nbsp;360 Wellness is a decentralised and unique live wellness marketplace concept. It's really a robust set of web and mobile applications that connect individuals with health and fitness specialists all over the world. <\/p><p>Let's now look at what kind of incredible stuff you will be learning in this course titled <strong>\"New-Age Technologies For Fitness Trainers\" <\/strong>that has been created by<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Piyush\".<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>We will learn that technological advancements continue to have an enormous impact on practically every aspect of our life.

Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.<\/p><p>The earliest incarnations of JavaScript were developed in the late 1990s for the Netscape Navigator Web browser. At the time, Web pages were static, offering little user interaction beyond clicking links and <strong>loading new pages<\/strong>. For the first time, JavaScript enabled animation, adaptive content and form validation on the page.<\/p><p>For many years, JavaScript only functioned on a limited number of browsers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the largest browser base, did not support JavaScript until much later. Instead, Microsoft created its own proprietary client-side script called JScript. In the early days of <strong>Web development<\/strong>, programmers who wished to create dynamic websites were often forced to choose one browser family over the other. This was less than ideal because it made the Internet less universally accessible.<\/p><p>JavaScript did not become standardized and widely adopted until 1999. Even after standardization, browser compatibility remained an issue for over a decade.<\/p><p><strong>How does JavaScipt work?<\/strong><\/p><p>JavaScript is what is known as a client-side script. Most Web applications, <strong>such as a search engine<\/strong>, work because of an interaction between the user's device (e.g. computer, <strong>phone or tablet<\/strong>) and a remote server. The software on the remote server sends information to the client (i.e. the user's machine) and the software on the client side reads the information and renders a Web page on screen.<br><br>A client-side script is a programming language that performs its tasks entirely on the client's machine and does not need to interact with the server to function. For instance, if you have a Web page loaded on your computer and your Internet service provider goes down, you are still able to interact with the Web pages already loaded on your browser. You will not, however, be able to navigate to new Web pages or access any data located remotely.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>This JavaScript course is designed to take you zero to hero in coding.

As a secondary benefit, automated sandboxing eliminates the time it would take to reverse engineer a file to discover the malicious code.<\/p><p>This course aims to point out the security essentials for any given IT organization.
